# Privacy-Preserving Methods: k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, and t-Closeness

This project explores and compares three widely-used privacy-preserving techniques: **k-Anonymity**, **l-Diversity**, and **t-Closeness**. These methods play a crucial role in protecting personal information during data sharing and analysis.

### üìñ About the Project

This project explores and compares three widely-used privacy-preserving techniques: **k-Anonymity**, **l-Diversity**, and **t-Closeness**. These methods are essential for protecting personal information during data sharing and analysis.

#### Objectives:

1. **Safeguard Personal Information**: Prevent sensitive data disclosures while retaining data usability.
2. **Provide Implementation Insights**: Deliver theoretical knowledge, practical implementations, and performance evaluations.
3. **Guide Privacy Strategy Selection**: Help users identify the most suitable privacy-preserving method for their needs.

By implementing and comparing these techniques, the project aims to promote safer data management practices and enhance public awareness of data privacy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

#### **1. Data Preprocessing**

Before applying privacy-preserving techniques, the dataset is cleaned and prepared:

- **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Exclude irrelevant features.
- **Handle Missing Data**: Eliminate or impute incomplete entries.
- **Clean and Normalize**: Ensure consistency for further analysis.

#### **2. Privacy Preservation Techniques**

The project implements the following methods sequentially:

##### **k-Anonymity**
- Ensures that each record is indistinguishable from at least **k-1 other records**.
- Reduces data granularity to protect individuals.

##### **k-Anonymity + l-Diversity**
- Extends k-anonymity by ensuring that **sensitive attributes** have at least **l diverse values** in each anonymized group.
- Guards against homogeneity and background knowledge attacks.

##### **k-Anonymity + l-Diversity + t-Closeness**
- Adds t-closeness, ensuring the **distribution of sensitive attributes** within each group closely matches the dataset‚Äôs overall distribution.
- Prevents skewness and similarity attacks.

#### **3. Model Training and Evaluation**

To assess the impact of privacy-preserving techniques on data utility:

- **Models Used**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compare accuracy, efficiency, and performance across datasets with varying privacy levels.
